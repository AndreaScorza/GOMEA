Computations stops after two generations with no changes in the population
First problem instance, L3-20-20, populaiton of 10 averaged over 100 runs

Using the linkage tree leads to a fewer number of generations due to premature convergence,
it happens more frequently to not find the optimum solutions

Legend: Generation it stopped, which generation was the maximum found, all the final element are the same ?

Normal Linkage tree, double allowed:

Now testing with bigger problem instance L2-50-100 and bigger population : 100

Normal Linkage tree, double allowed:

[5, 1, False]
[5, 1, False]

Random Linkage tree, double allowed:

[8, 1, False]

5.0   1.0

When double is not allowed a major delay in the processing has been recorder, this is due to the increased number of generations
