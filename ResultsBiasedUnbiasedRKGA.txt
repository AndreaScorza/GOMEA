Starting with a small instance: L3-20-20, population 10, stop after 100 gen without improvemnt or 1000 total
For this instance, resuts are averaged over 1000 runs

in small problem instances it is purely random, hence it is unclear if there is a correlation,
with harder instances however the bias allowes the algorithm to perform better

It seems that the tables have turned, now the BRKGA performs better, let's see the results over 1000 runs.

The fact that RKGA performed better then BRKGA for this specific problem instance
could have been due to the small population size compared to the size of the problem instance (50-100)
with a small population size and a more aggressive selection bias in the case of the BRKGA compared
to the RKGA there was a loos of diversity, hence RKGA waws performing better

This time there is no difference between the two executions.
the population was probably too big and both the algorithms were able to find the solution very early,
let's try again but with a smaller population size 30

Same median again, there is no significant difference.
Having tried with a smaller problem instance like L3-20-20 with a population of 20, there is the same result
maybe is the stopping criteria. now repeating the experiment withouth the stopping criteria:
pop 20, problem L3-20-20 there was a difference of 2 point in the median of the generation,
and that was the only difference, one algorithm converge faster then the other

pop 30, 250-1000 but without the aforementioned stopping criteria, stop after 200 no improv (instead of 250)
and for 500 runs, instead of 1000 (to speed things up a little)

So it seems that with the right population size, the BRKGA is able to converge faster to the solution
