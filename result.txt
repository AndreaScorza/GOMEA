Biased and Unbiased RKGA

Bean (1994) selects two parents at random from the entire population to implement mating in a RKGA
and allows a parent to be selected more than once in a given generation. One parent is referred to as
parent A while the other is parent B. A biased random-key genetic algorithm, or BRKGA (Gon√ßalves & Resende, 2011),
differs from a RKGA in the way parents are selected for mating. In a BRKGA, each element is generated combining
one element selected at random from the elite partition (this is parent A) in the current population and one
from the non-elite partition (parent B). We say the selection is biased since one parent is always an elite
individual. Repetition in the selection of a mate is allowed and therefore an individual can produce more than
one offspring in the same generation
