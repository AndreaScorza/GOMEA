best fitness =  3380.123  time:  0.29

GOMEA
(3380.123, 5.89)

Both algorithm converged to the best result at the first generation (population= 10 in this case is too much)

BRKGA
best fitness =  3082.78  time:  0.99
Converged at 18th generation (in a second try it converged at 36th generation)

GOMEA
(3082.78, 152.54)
Converged at 1st generation (in a second try it converged at 3rd generation)

BRKGA
best fitness =  48932.9  time:  21.24
Converged at 3rd generation (in a second try it converged at 13th generation)

GOMEA
- with population 10 it is stuck inside a local optima witout possibility to grow
- with population 30
First try
1  :  48932.9  time:  56.02
second try
1  :  48932.9  time:  52.5
- with population 15
