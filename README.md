The following code is about the implementation and comparison of the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm and the Gene-Pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm,
on the Winner Determination Problem in Multi-Combinatorial Auctions.

This has to be regarded as my implementation and not the official one from Bosman et al. which can be found at (https://homepages.cwi.nl/~bosman/source_code.php).

The problem instances are generated with the Combinatorial Auction Test Suite.
